# StatZone üìà

StatZone is an NBA Utility Stat bot meant to bring ease of access and statistics to Discord. Now you can look up a player's stats or strengths and weaknesses without leaving your application or server! Whether you're managing a fantasy team, debating with friends, or just curious about player performance, StatZone provides the information you need in seconds. StatZone is in its beta phases and is currently set up to work for the 2024-2025 NBA season.

## Description üèÄ

StatZone has a lot of capabilities and commands that you can use.
- **ping**: Tells you if the bot is online and functional!
- **playerStats**: Prints out all the stats a player has averaged through a season, including but not limited to PPG, APG, RPG, and PER.
- **filterByStat**: Allows you to filter through the player_database based on a specific attribute and threshold. For example, if you are looking for elite passers, you can use this command to find all players who have a Passing rating above 90.
- **player_strengths_weaknesses**: Given a player, returns their strengths and their weaknesses. Especially useful to scout a draft class.
- **roster**: Returns a team's current roster.
- **allStars**: Returns the all-stars for the current year.

## Technologies üñ•Ô∏è

StatZone was developed using the following technologies:
- Python
- Discord API
- JSON functionality
- FuzzySearch Implementation

This project uses Python and integrates Discord's API for bot functionality. By leveraging data scraping techniques and JSON functionality, StatZone compiles accurate, up-to-date information for users. Its user-friendly commands ensure that all Discord users can benefit from its features. StatZone uses FuzzySearch implementation as an autocorrect measure to account for user error. This way, misspelling a player or team name won't impact the bot's ability to provide the user with the correct information.
